# xbox360-controller-driver
Driver for the Xbox 360 controller written in Rust. I'm not entirely sure why you would ever want to use this, but I was so insanely bored that I thought this was a good idea.

## Platform
I've only tested this on Linux, but it might work on Windows/macOS. I do not plan to test this on either of the latter platforms.
